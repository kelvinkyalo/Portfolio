        <h2>Education background</h2>
        <p>I pursued a degree in Pharmacy at Jomo Kenyatta university of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) <br>
            for two years.I decided to pause my course and pursue a course in Software Engineering.</p>
        <h2>Work experience</h2>
        <p>I have not yet had the opportunity to be employed by an organisation so far but this is because i have not
            yet applied for any job opportunity.
            I have been self-employed from the year 2016,I own two movie shops in Juja as a side hustle.
        </p>
        <p>The reason as to why i decided to pursue programming is that ever since i can remember as a kid i was always
            fascinated with technology and its funtionalities.
            I decide to pursue Software Engineering in order to learn how to create interactive websites and be able to
            understand back-end coding </p>

                    the provided guide in the LMS .It basically showcases my application of the content covered on the

            <p>This website was made from a forking process from github,I worked on it and made some significant changes
                as
                I practiced some new features I learnt from this weeks content.The website is designed to work for a
                photographer where he can post his work and market his trade to his clientele.

                different
                yet similar movie concepts.
                The fans of the two groups get to see different attributes of their rivals and comment on them.

                the
                terminal and how to link my local projects to the git app and later upload them to the remote location
                on github.
